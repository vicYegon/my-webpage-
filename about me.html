            Hello, I am <strong class="name">Victor Yegon.</strong> <br>
            I'm a software engineer and currently based in Nairobi, Kenya<br>
            Moreover, I am a Kenyan by birth and also, my education and intellectual life has been in Kenyan schools.<br>
            I started my journey in loving computing at a young age through gaming and problem solving. My problem <br>
            solving became emanent through Microsoft Excel when I joined high school. Later, when I joined campus at<br>
            Egerton University Main Campus, Njoro. I extended my computing and programming career journey where, I studied <br>
            computer science as a course but later after three years, I dropped out due to unavoidable reasons. This however <br>
            didn't destort my dream in computing and problem solving. Because, since then I have been a self-taught softaware <br>
            developer majorly learning design and the front-end part of progarmming. However, I have also been able <br>
            to learn the fundamentals of varied progaramming languages to guide in my back-end developent skills.<br>
            Currently, I am studying software engineering at <a href="https://jengaschool.com/" class="links">Jenga School</a> in Nairobi, Kenya. This is to elavate my <br>
            skills career-wise and also to act in helping my probelem skill to be in accordance to the industry level.
