        <p>
            I'm VICTOR KIPKOSGEI YEGON, a software developer currently based in Nairobi, Kenya.<br>
            Also, I am a Kenyan citizen by birth. My education, development and intellectual life has been in Kenyas' schools.<br>
            I started my journey in computing at a young age through gaming and later learnt how easier problem solving became through<br> 
            the use of computers. My problem solving became emanent when i joined high school. This is where I mastered the art of <br>
            using Microsoft Excel and programming.<br>
            Later, when I joined campus at Egerton University Main Campus, Njoro. I extended my computing and programming <br>
            career journey where, I studied computer science as a course but later after three years, I dropped out due to unavoidable reasons.<br> 
            This however didn't destort my dream in problem solving. Because of this also, i have since been a self-taught softaware <br>
            developer majorly learning design and the front-end progarmming.<br> 
            Moreover, I have also been able to learn the fundamentals of varied progaramming languages to guide in my back-end developent<br> 
            skills.<br>
            I have also been offering general computing solutions such as hardware repair and teaching simple<br> 
            computer and programming skills to primary and high school students in various schools.<br>
            Recently, I enrolled to a course in studying software engineering at <a href="https://jengaschool.com/" class="links">Jenga School</a> <br>
            in Nairobi, Kenya. This is to elavate my career skills to an industrial level.<br>
            Learning new technologies facinates me and how they can be used to solve real time problems in my country and even all over<br> 
            the universe. Also, i enjoy listening to coding talks and peers who already have a prowess in the software development field.<br> 
            Nevertheless, I get moved by their indulgence and successes. It's among the motivations to why i chose a career in this  <br>
            particular field while i was still young. However, it took me time to fully dive in because of being brought up in a humble<br>
            environs in my country where accessing a computer was previously tough and even seemed impossible.
