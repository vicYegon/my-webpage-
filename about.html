        <h2>About Me <i class="fa-solid fa-address-card"></i></h2>
        <br>
        <p>I'm VICTOR KIPKOSGEI YEGON, a software developer currently based in Nairobi, Kenya. 
            I'm a fullstack developer with an experience of about two years. 
            I also sometimes do research, majorly in new technologies in the market &
            UI/UX field.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a Kenyan citizen by birth, male and straight relationship-wise. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            I have been a self-taught developer for a while, and in doing so brought me to 
            being a freelance developer who took tasks localy from clients. I
            wentforth and joined Jenga School in Nairobi, Kenya for a certification in Software Engineering. 
            And it's due to these, I've been able to learn the fundamentals to advanced levels of 
            various front-end and backend programming languages and elavated 
            my skills in software developent career.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nevertheless, learning new software technologies fascinates me. It's a new, unique and 
            an interesting chance to use technologies remotely to change the norm at home (Africa, 
            Kenya) for the better.
            <br>
            <br> 
            I encourage collaborations and new ideas to my ongoing projects and career respectively.
            <br>
            I'm always eager to learn and grow.
